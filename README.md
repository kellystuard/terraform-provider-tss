# Terraform Provider for Thycotic Secret Server

:information_source: Since writing this provider, Thycotic has published their own provider to the registry. It can be found at https://registry.terraform.io/providers/thycotic/tss/latest.

:information_source: This provider is in no way authorized or affiliated with Thycotic. I have no association with the company, other than working for a company that uses their Secret Server product. To my knowledge, neither I nor Thycotic provide commercial support for this product. If you have a problem with how the product works, either file an issue or submit a pull request.

This provider has been published to the Terraform Registry at https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kellystuard/tss.

## Adding Dependencies

This provider uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
Please see the Go documentation for the most up to date information about using Go modules.

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
