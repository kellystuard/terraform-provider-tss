# Thycotic Secret Server Provider

The Thycotic Secret Server provider provides resources to interact with a Thycotic Secret Server API.

It is not recommended to use your own account for management of secrets. A user specific to
Terraform is recommended. You can create a **Limited Admin** with **Local Access Only** and
provide that information for authentication. Two-factor authentication is not supported in the provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "tss" {
  username = "john"
  password = "John's super-secret password"
  tenant   = "johnvault"
}
```
