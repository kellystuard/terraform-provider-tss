# Thycotic Secret Server Provider

The [Thycotic Secret Server](https://thycotic.com/products/secret-server/) provider provides resources to interact with a Thycotic Secret Server [REST API](https://updates.thycotic.net/secretserver/restapiguide/).

It is not recommended to use your own account for management of secrets. A user specific to
Terraform is recommended. You can create a user with **Application Account** checked and
provide that information for authentication. Two-factor authentication is not supported in the provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "tss" {
  username = "john"
  password = "John's super-secret password"
  tenant   = "johnvault"
}
```
